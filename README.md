## Run it

To use it on a host with libvirtd running, use the prepared docker image

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
docker run \
    --volume=/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:Z \
    --name vadvisor \
    --publish 8181:8181 \
    --detach=true \
    virtkube/vadvisor:latest
```
vAdvisor can now be accessed on port `8181`.

### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora

If you are using RHEL, CentOS or Fedora you need to add the `--privileged` flag
because otherwise SELinux does not allow it to access the libvirt socket:

```bash
docker run \
    --volume=/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:Z \
    --name vadvisor \
    --publish 8181:8181 \
    --detach=true \
    --privileged \
    virtkube/vadvisor:latest
```

## Prometheus

VM runtime metrics are exposed at `/metrics`. When accessing the endpoind a
live sample of all currently detected VMs will be returned. This is different
to the metrics REST endpoint below where historical samples for the last minute
are returned.

Each VM has one metric called `vm_up` which is `1` if the VM is in `Running` state.
If the VM is in any other state `vm_up` will report `0`.

Further `vm_up` can be used to filter out stale metrics reported by prometheus
since prometheus keep reporting disappeared metrics for another 5 minutes if
the scrape target is still reachable. To achieve this `vm_up` reports `0` for
another 10 minutes after a VM disappeard or was shut off. 

## REST-API

### Polling metrics

VM runtime metrics are exposed at `/api/v1.0/stats`. The endpoint returns metrics
for all discovered VMs.

The endpoint `/api/v1.0/stats` supports the additional query parameter
`live=true` which allows to ask for live samples of all VMs. This can be very
useful when another service is already periodically monitoring the system and
you need fresh samples instead of the whole history.

To query for a specific VM you can the uuid of a VM to the endpoint like this
`/api/v1.0/stats/<uuid>`.

The result contains raw sample data from the last minute for every VM. Since
all VMs are sampled every second you will get an array of up to 60 samples per
VM.

### Event stream

VM lifecycle changes can be monitored at `/api/v1.0/events`.

The following query parameters are supported:

| Parameter           | Description                                   | Default           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
|`stream`             |Stream events as they occur.                   | false             |
|`start_time`         |Start time of events to query (`stream=false`) | Beginning of time |
|`end_time`           |End time of events to query (`stream=false`)   | Now               |
|`max_events`         |Number of events to return (`stream=false`)    | 10                |
|`all_events`         |Return all supported events                    | false             |
|`undefined_events`   |Include delete events                          | false             |
|`defined_events`     |Include create events                          | false             |
|`started_events`     |Include start events                           | false             |
|`suspended_events`   |Include supend events                          | false             |
|`resumed_events`     |Include resume events                          | false             |
|`stopped_events`     |Include stop events                            | false             |
|`shutdown_events`    |Include shutdown events                        | false             |
|`pmsuspended_events` |Include power management suspended events      | false             |
|`crashed_events`     |Include crash events                           | false             |

For example to listen for all lifecycle events as they occure run

```bash
curl -N 'http://localhost:8181/api/v1.0/events?stream=true&all_events=true'
```

### Specifications

VM Specifications are exposed at `/api/v1.0/specs`. It will return an array of
all discovered VMs with their Libvirt XML specifcations translated into JSON.

To query for a specific VM use the endpoint `/api/v1.0/specs/<id>` where `id`
can either be the UUID or the name of a VM.

## cAdvisor/Heapster

The prometheus endpoint from vAdvisor can be reused be cAdvisor to collect all
vAdvisor metrics as custom metrics. Then they are exposed by cAdvisor and
heapster can collect them.

To enable this feature you have to add to the vAdvisor docker image the
metadata where cAdvisor can find a file which contains the metrics definition.

A full docker run would look like this:

```
docker run \
    --volume=/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:Z \
    --name vadvisor \
    --publish 8181:8181 \
    --detach=true \
    --privileged \
    --label io.cadvisor.metric.prometheus-vadvisor="/var/vadvisor/cadvisor_config.json" \
    --volume cadvisor_config.json:/var/vadvisor/cadvisor_config.json \
    virtkube/vadvisor:latest
```
The `cadvisor_config.json` should then contain a URL which is accessible from
other containers or form the host. For instance in kubernetes, containers can
access each other through localhost as long as they are in the same pod. In
that case `cadvisor_config.json` looks like this:

```json
{
    "endpoint" : "http://localhost:8181/metrics"
}
```

In cas of docker networking substituting `localhost` with the container name
should be enough.

## StatsD

To export the VM metrics to a StatsD compatible agent you can use the
commandline arguments `--statsd-host`, `--statsd-port` and `--statsd-interval`.
As soon as you specify a host, vAdvisor will start exporting the metrics.

This configuration
```bash
docker run \
    --volume=/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro:Z \
    --name vadvisor \
    --publish 8181:8181 \
    --detach=true \
    --privileged \
    virtkube/vadvisor:latest \
    --statsd-host 192.168.0.5
    --statsd-port 8125
    --statsd-interval 15
```
will export VM metrics every `15` seconds to the statsd server at `192.168.0.5:5145`.
